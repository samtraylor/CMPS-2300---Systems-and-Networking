	After the first client is connected to the server, connecting another client to the same socket with the same IP works (we know this because neither the connect nor socket errors are given, rather the message prompt which implies success). However, any message this second connected client tries to send doesnt come through to the server terminal, and if you try to connect a third client, that's when it times out. A fourth and fifth do the same. If you close the first client while the others are trying to connect, the 2nd created client (the one with a send message prompt) now has its message show up on the server terminal. Also, the client that was originally third in line now shows the same state as the second client originally did, where it connects with a message prompt, but the messages dont come through to the server.
